Project Proposal is due 2015-04-08 at 8am

# Project Title: The Sherman Keyboard
### Problem Statement
We were unable to find any public virtual instruments written in Scheme, so we decided to make our own.

### Problem Analysis
We will be using data abstraction, modularity, object oriented concepts including inheritance, and data mutability. 

### Data set or other source materials

These sources will be used as reference for understanding how to modify sine waves to add effects and to emulate different instruments:

### Deliverable and Demonstration
By the end of this project we will have a working keyboard that produces audio using sine waves. We will implement a
number of features, including a volume slider and options to manipulate the frequency and amplitude of different sine
waves.

### Evaluation of Results
We will know that we are successful based on if the piano plays the correct notes, sounds good, and has ample
features.

## Work Plan and Schedule
First we will create a working UI that plays very basic sounds just to get a feel for the project. Next, we will
begin experimenting with additive synthesis and incorporating different user settings into the UI to manipulate
the audio waves. 

### First Milestone (04-13)
On this day, we will have a working UI that resembles a keyboard and plays basic tones using the mouse. 

### Second Milestone (04-21)
On this day, we will have changed the basic tones to real sine waves and we will add more functionality to the UI,
allowing users to manipulate the audio more, including a volume slider and the ability to generate at least two
harmonics in tandem to the fundamental note to form a more complex wave. We will also have the synth working with
both the mouse and the keyboard.

## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this
project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.

### Stuart Tomkins
I will be writing the UI for the keyboard, as well as the event handling. This includes clicking the on screen keys
as well as mapping keys on the keyboard to play the piano. 

### Eamon Lightning
I will be using the concepts of additive synthesis to utilize tools in the portaudio library to generate multiple
sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes, and combine them to form more complex waves that are capable of
emulating more natural or interesting sounds. 

### Kevin Wacome 
I will be contributing to the UI by working on the section that allows users to manipulate different sine waves in
terms of their amplitude and frequency. Also, I'll experiment with different combinations of harmonics and amplitudes
to emulate the timbres of popular instruments, and provide users with a selectable list of good presets.
